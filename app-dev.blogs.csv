Over several years as a digital marketer and content manager, I’ve watched a multitude of companies throw piles of money at online advertising platforms, trying and failing to engage prospective customers.

The four pillars of what I call the REAL framework are Relationships, Education, Amusement, and Lead Magnets. Each pillar provides content guidelines and actionable steps that, when combined, will help you drive sustainable, organic growth through your marketing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," <div className=""col-12 py-3"">\n                           <div className=""flex flex-column gap-2"">\n                              <label htmlFor=""description"">Description</label>\n                              <Field name=""description"">\n                                 {({\n                                    field,\n                                    form,\n                                 }: {\n                                    field: {\n                                       value: string;\n                                       onChange: (e: React.ChangeEvent<any>) => void;\n                                    };\n                                    form: any;\n                                 }) => (",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,shakir@infomover.io,logistics-dev,Muhammed Shakir,Misarwala,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile_images/shakir@infomover.io/shakir.jpg,"""f212bf1ecee28eddc2e7678c0fa8b743""",BLOG_COVER_IMAGE,2024-12-12T12:20:38.356Z,2024-12-12T12:20:38.356Z,image/png,Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 2.36.05â¯PM.png,106872,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/675801c14cac09741d2f2375/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 2.36.05â¯PM.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/675801c14cac09741d2f2375/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 2.36.05â¯PM.png,"""f212bf1ecee28eddc2e7678c0fa8b743""",200,7XW130S121T175D6,9ixUiFXOhaelZdyhuc9scMcGuqPMZOPtQmRDhOhz5/EBFW6q0RylSR7R1CvPxIQ9brIEHC+5VV2+b3p8oiogvg==,,1,0,"""f212bf1ecee28eddc2e7678c0fa8b743""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/675801c14cac09741d2f2375/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 2.36.05â¯PM.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/675801c14cac09741d2f2375/Screenshot%202024-11-05%20at%202.36.05%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%AFPM.png,Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 2.36.05â¯PM.png,,,106872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,1007,,"Compared with traditional advertising and outreach methods like cold calls that chase quick sales, the REAL framework prioritizes relatability, authenticity, knowledge, and value to build long-term trust with customers.

Follow along by copying and pasting the prompts sequentially into ChatGPT. Once you’ve experimented with this generic project, you can customize the prompts with specific details from your real-world needs. At that point, remember to complete your custom instructions and follow the prompting recommendations above.\n\n","Asking a cascade of questions without waiting for a response will lead to frustration and inefficiency on both sides of a conversation. Often, the team member won’t remember everything that was asked and will only formulate partial responses. As a result, it will take longer for the manager to receive the desired information. It is better to ask one question at a time and raise subsequent questions after receiving the previous response.","Managers can encourage healthy team dynamics by tailoring questions for specific individuals and groups, especially when establishing team goals and expectations at the beginning of a project. These audience-specific questions, available for download, establish a baseline of trust and allow individuals to clarify needs and communication preferences.","As a project manager, I have found that building team trust starts with asking myself questions about the purpose and expectations of each team meeting. When I am clear about the answers, it becomes easier to guide the team and other project stakeholders toward our shared goals. As a starting point, I recommend that managers pause and ask themselves the following questions before scheduling any team meeting: \n\nWhat is the reason for having this meeting? \nWhat do I want to achieve with this meeting?\nIf participants leave the meeting with only one essential takeaway, what should that be?\nWhat are the goals of the other meeting participants?\nHow long does the meeting need to be to achieve these goals?\nDo I need help? If so, who can help me in my endeavors? ","Before we investigate strategies for asking good questions, we must consider the objectives of improving this communication skill. First and foremost, posing thoughtful and well-intentioned questions can reinforce trust and self-efficacy—two characteristics that indicate positive team dynamics and are frequently associated with increased productivity. Conversely, asking poorly worded or judgmental-sounding questions can do the opposite.Both directive and nondirective questions are valuable depending on a manager’s goals. Directive questions specify the type of response needed and may be necessary when a manager wants to influence the course of a conversation or project. Nondirective questions are more open-ended and are effective when a manager wants to bring people together, enhance creativity, foster a safe space, or maximize learning opportunities. \n\nA directive question could relate to decision-making: “Do you have any concerns with prioritizing bug fixing now and finishing the in-progress feature in the upcoming sprint?” While this framing allows the team member to express reservations about the objectives or timeline, the manager specifies key expectations. However, if there’s time for deliberation, the manager could opt for a nondirective alternative: “How do you think this bug-fixing request should be handled?” Requests for status updates can be either directive (“Have you solved the issue raised by the customer?”) or nondirective (“What options do we have to solve the issue raised by the customer?”).","Effective prompting is crucial for interacting with AI tools like ChatGPT and requires a very structured approach, especially when drafting materials for real-world projects. The following are five components of effective prompt engineering:\n\n\n1 -:Identify your professional context: Include details about your role, industry, project intentions, and so forth. Example: “As an experienced project manager, I am preparing a project plan for the development and deployment of a community app for volunteers who help with the maintenance and improvement of our local parks.”\nProvide project details: Always specify tasks, resources, and other project details, being sure to describe the composition of your team. Example: “We have a team of three developers, a product manager, a tester, and a Scrum master to build this app.”\nBe precise: If you need an output to include certain elements, describe them clearly. Example: “Create a project plan with durations, resources, and risks.”\nClarify constraints: Be sure to outline limiting factors like budgets, schedules, and available resources. Example: “Create a project plan with no more than 100 tasks.”\nSpecify output format: The current version of ChatGPT can generate output in formatted text, including tables. The DALL-E 3 extension can generate infographics, and the Data Analyst extension creates charts and graphs. Be clear about which format you need. Example: “Create a list of tasks in a tabular format.”",,,,,,,,,,"""f83640bb0f401e809fd26df6994e02ee""","""00ce3fe39d9c37d0212060b53891d59a""",,,,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,,,2024-12-10T10:34:12.725Z,2024-12-10T10:30:50.821Z,,,,,,,2024-12-10T10:34:12.725Z,2024-12-10T10:30:50.821Z,,,,,,,image/jpeg,image/png,,,,,,,apple-laptops-price.jpg,images.png,,,,,,,33484,22353,,,,,,,hiretalentt,hiretalentt,,,,,,,blog_section_image/10122024160412/apple-laptops-price.jpg,blog_section_image/10122024160050/images.png,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/10122024160412/apple-laptops-price.jpg,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/10122024160050/images.png,,,,,,,"""f83640bb0f401e809fd26df6994e02ee""","""00ce3fe39d9c37d0212060b53891d59a""",,,,,,,200,200,,,,,,,CG35DYBP2JTEZQWV,6220M9FRRT4DQNP5,,,,,,,TLQrYK2e8OFIIve16sgif91/e+0FS7b8OmWxEKOlmDcna6fxXLNtCwt0A1qfjbCkaiNDRI0S0iU=,rR53BP/MN4t7HrQDuUVXNzcG5+6JC3kQZGHIsAdFyfnNxrlOptTExEligGJvaCUc0FTaljrkaeZGMz3JRUzhxw==,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,"""f83640bb0f401e809fd26df6994e02ee""","""00ce3fe39d9c37d0212060b53891d59a""",,,,,,,AES256,AES256,,,,,,,hiretalentt,hiretalentt,,,,,,,blog_section_image/10122024160412/apple-laptops-price.jpg,blog_section_image/10122024160050/images.png,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/10122024160412/apple-laptops-price.jpg,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/10122024160050/images.png,,,,,,,apple-laptops-price.jpg,images.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33484,22353,,,,,,"package com.im.trainings.java.model;\n\npublic class LocalCustomer extends Customer {\n\n    @Override\n    public void generateCreditBalance() {\n        System.out.println(""Generating creditBalance for Local Customer in "" + this.getClass().getName());\n\n    }\n}",,"public class CollectionsDemo {\n\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();\n        names.add(""Iftekhar"");\n        names.add(""Priya"");\n        names.add(""Mustafa"");\n\n        List<String> names2 = List.of(""Iftekhar"", ""Umar Shaikh"", ""Ahmed Shaikh"", ""Anju"", ""Priya"");\n\n        System.out.println(names2);\n        List<String> allShaikhsOfBhopal = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (String s : names2) {\n            if (s.contains(""Shaikh"")) {\n                allShaikhsOfBhopal.add(s);\n            }\n        }\n        System.out.println("" ---- "");\n\n        System.out.println(allShaikhsOfBhopal);\n\n        List<String> fil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6757fbafb0c5736f0b04905c,6757fbafb0c5736f0b04905d,Mehtab,,,"""2f85458a784fd3df106061847271c755""",BLOG_COVER_IMAGE,2024-12-10T10:28:28.822Z,2024-12-10T10:28:28.822Z,image/avif,images (1).avif,18215,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images (1).avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images (1).avif,"""2f85458a784fd3df106061847271c755""",200,K2GT0BAYCV92NE4X,fW6NMakOlC+0USXATHGMnn1TfKf0iiBp9kZTv27xrHMBlzXCNXAAqmVwFTnJzFMunr04m+SAq3c=,,1,0,"""2f85458a784fd3df106061847271c755""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images (1).avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images%20%281%29.avif,images (1).avif,,,18215,"""00ce3fe39d9c37d0212060b53891d59a""",BLOG_THUMBNAIL_IMAGE,2024-12-10T10:45:12.130Z,2024-12-10T10:45:12.130Z,image/png,images.png,22353,hiretalentt,blog_thumbnail_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_thumbnail_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images.png,"""00ce3fe39d9c37d0212060b53891d59a""",200,1TYGYS1GRQYWGYH5,WpYu4dzevGxqXyp8Llpu13ZCaM7x5OY1Z1Nq1oCd/5mdXohtfWLa8NRPAMdVwlwSK37i2fu927pTqPMB6yzXpg==,,1,0,"""00ce3fe39d9c37d0212060b53891d59a""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_thumbnail_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_thumbnail_image/6758179eb54b383ae788eb99/images.png,images.png,,2024-12-10T10:45:12.130Z,22353,false,57,,"The types of information ChatGPT can produce are endless, but here I walk through several use cases for project management, starting with a basic project description and then asking for a series of additional project artifacts.

Over the past decade, I’ve helped companies strategically integrate outreach messaging into their marketing campaigns, alongside digital strategies such as social media, SEO, and paid digital advertising, to nurture high-quality leads with personalized interactions at each step of the customer journey.\n\nStreamlining outreach efforts is especially necessary today, given that customer relationship management (CRM) spending is expected to slow across industries, according to spring 2024 data from The CMO Survey. If companies can’t find creative ways to automate outreach and do more with limited resources, they risk losing out to competitors who can. However, automation must never come at the expense of personalization; in 2021, McKinsey & Company surveyed consumers and found that 76% felt frustrated when brand interactions were not tailored to their needs and interests. How can digital marketers balance these simultaneous expectations to automate and personalize customer interactions?","Once a company has acquired initial leads through awareness-stage outreach, a web search, or even a direct referral, it’s time to begin nurturing those relationships. The consideration stage is the point at which a lead, now aware of the brand, begins to look more closely at its products or services. To support this consideration, brands should use audience insights to tailor their outreach efforts, prioritizing precise, personalized messages.","After a new lead has been acquired and nurtured through conversion, it’s important to continue engaging that individual to achieve sustained customer loyalty and, ultimately, brand advocacy. While attracting new leads is always desirable, never take repeat customers for granted, as it generally requires less investment to inspire them to make another purchase. Fortunately, many of the techniques and tools used for outreach marketing automation at earlier stages work equally well for fostering and deepening relationships with existing customers, whether it’s via social media, email marketing, or periodic check-ins from sales team members based on automated lead scoring.\n\nLoyalty-stage outreach automation ideas: segmentation based on multichannel integration for follow-up sequences and Net Promoter Score.\n",Further Reading on the Toptal Blog:\nThe Financial Implications of Using AI in Marketing\nHow Top Brands Are Using AR Marketing Techniques\nDigital Advertising for Small Businesses: A 6-step Plan for Building E-commerce Success\nHow to Create an SEO Keyword Strategy With Color-coded Priorities\nBoost Ad Performance on Facebook and Instagram With Advanced Audience Targeting,"AI outreach platforms will continue to revolutionize marketing strategies and become the industry standard for customer engagement. One of AI’s most significant advantages is its ability to deliver hyper-relevant, personalized messages to customers at each stage of their journey—from initial awareness to loyal brand advocacy. This level of audience targeting and smart sequencing ensures that marketing efforts resonate more deeply with each individual.\n\nOf course, delivering this kind of personalized outreach still requires a human touch, but AI frees up marketing and sales teams from repetitive tasks and allows them to focus on strategy and personalized, human-to-human engagement, making every interaction more meaningful. Companies can leverage AI to streamline their outreach efforts in ways that unlock time and resource optimizations while enhancing the quality of their customer relationships. This dual benefit is critical to thrive in the modern digital landscape, guaranteeing that businesses stay ahead in both efficiency and customer satisfaction.","As a good JavaScript developer, you strive to write clean, healthy, and maintainable code. While you solve interesting and unique challenges, you’ve likely found that you’re often writing code that looks similar to the code for an entirely different problem you’ve handled before. You may not know it, but you’ve used a design pattern.\n\n\n\n\nDuring any language’s lifespan, many such reusable solutions are made and tested by a large number of developers from that language’s community. It is because of this combined experience of many developers that such solutions are so useful because they help us write code in an optimized way while at the same time solving the problem at hand.\n\nThe main benefits we get from design patterns are the following:\n\nThey are proven solutions: Because design patterns are often used by many developers, you can be certain that they work. And not only that, you can be certain that they were revised multiple times and optimizations were probably implemented.\nThey are easily reusable: Design patterns document a reusable solution which can be modified to solve multiple particular problems, as they are not tied to a specific problem.\nThey are expressive: Design patterns can explain a large solution quite elegantly.\nThey ease communication: When developers are familiar with design patterns, they can more easily communicate with one another about potential solutions to a given problem.\nThey prevent the need for refactoring code: If an application is written with design patterns in mind, it is often the case that you won’t need to refactor the code later on because applying the correct design pattern to a given problem is already an optimal solution.\nThey lower the size of the codebase: Because design patterns are usually elegant and optimal solutions, they usually require less code than other solutions.\nI know you’re ready to jump in at this point, but before you learn all about design patterns in JavaScript, let’s review some basics.\n\nA Brief History of JavaScript\nJavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages for web development today. It was initially made as a sort of a “glue” for various displayed HTML elements, known as a client-side scripting language, for one of the initial web browsers. Called Netscape Navigator, it could only display static HTML at the time. As you might assume, the idea of such a scripting language led to browser wars between the big players in the browser development industry back then, such as Netscape Communications (today Mozilla), Microsoft, and others.\n\nEach of the big players wanted to push through their own implementation of this scripting language, so Netscape made JavaScript (actually, Brendan Eich did), Microsoft made JScript, and so forth. As you can image, the differences between these implementations were great, so development for web browsers was made per-browser, with best-viewed-on stickers that came with a web page. It soon became clear that we needed a standard, a cross-browser solution which would unify the development process and simplify the creation of web pages. What they came up with is called ECMAScript.\n\nECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification which all modern browsers try to support, and there are multiple implementations (you could say dialects) of ECMAScript. The most popular one is the topic of this article, JavaScript. Since its initial release, ECMAScript has standardized a lot of important things, and for those more interested in the specifics, there is a detailed list of standardized items for each version of the ECMAScript available on Wikipedia. Browser support for ECMAScript versions 6 (ES6) and higher are still incomplete and have to be transpiled to ES5 in order to be fully supported.","The awareness stage is the point at which brand recognition begins for a new prospect. Content marketing and SEO campaigns are essential digital strategies for boosting awareness, given that organic search is a primary route that highly motivated prospects use to identify brands that fulfill specific needs. Paid advertising on social media is another common and successful awareness strategy. Digital customer outreach is a natural complement to these marketing efforts, allowing brands to engage their target audience in a personalized way right from the beginning.\n\nAutomation ideas for awareness-stage outreach efforts: chat marketing, multichannel integration capabilities, and social media scheduling and drafting.\n","The Python language has the functionality to consign many a VBA-filled spreadsheet, held together with sticky tape, to the recycle bin. Its ease of use and suitability for iterative development lends well to finance-based workflows. We delve into this and provides a brief tutorial.\n\n\n\nFor professions that have long relied on trawling through spreadsheets, Python is especially valuable. Citigroup, an American bank, has introduced a crash course in Python for its trainee analysts. - The Economist\n\nFinance professionals have long had access to VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) in Excel to build custom functionality and automate workflows. With the emergence in recent years of Google Sheets as a serious contender in the spreadsheet space, Google Apps Script now offers an additional choice.\n\nHowever, I would like to draw attention to a third option, the Python programming language, which has become tremendously popular in a number of fields.\n\nIn this article, I will provide some examples of what you can accomplish with Python in finance, starting with an overview of the language itself and why it has become so popular in such a wide variety of fields, ranging across web development, machine learning, finance, science, and education, just to name a few. The second half will then consist of a step-by-step tutorial.\n\nThe aim of me writing this is to help you decide whether Python looks intriguing enough for you to consider adding it to your financial toolbox. If you take the leap, there are many apps, courses, videos, articles, books and blog posts available to learn the language. At the end of the piece, I have listed some resources that have helped me along the way.\n\nUse Cases: My Python Finance Projects\nMy introduction to programming was learning BASIC on an Oric 1 in the mid-1980s. Back then BASIC was the most common beginner’s language. Other languages that I dabbled with in the late 80s until mid-90s were Pascal and C, but I never used them in any professional capacity, and I didn’t expect to need or use programming skills. To my knowledge at the time in the late 90s, finance and programming were very different fields, when I chose to embark on a career path in finance.\n\nFast forward to 2012, and I was looking to pick programming back up as a hobby, so I started researching the languages available at the time. It turned out quite a bit had happened, and when I came across Python I was hooked, for many of the reasons that I will outline in the next section. Since then I have used Python for a wide range of tasks, from small scripts to larger projects, both personally and professionally. Many, but not all, have involved spreadsheets, the workbench of many a finance professional.\n\nHere are a few examples of how well spreadsheets and Python can go together:\n\n1. Tracking Hundreds of Activities Over Time in an M&A Integration PMO Setup\nI work with all aspects of M&A transactions, not just the execution, but also integration. In a recent case, the PMO team decided on a hybrid program and project management approach, using waterfall planning and Gantt charts for high-level plans for each of the twelve integration workstreams, in addition to a Kanban board for tracking the hundreds of activities going on at any given time, in the first 100-day plan and beyond. The Kanban tool that was chosen, MeisterTask, has a number of statistical and reporting features, but our needs went beyond that in terms of analysis and presentation, which required a custom solution. This is the workflow that I automated using Python:\n\nSave status of the whole board weekly as a CSV file.\nRead all historical CSV files into a Pandas DataFrame.\nSort, filter, group and manipulate the data into agreed formats of how we want to track progress (by the status of activity, workstream, etc.).\nWrite the output to an Excel file with the data from each analysis within its own sheet, formatted in such a way that it can be simply copied and pasted into think-cell charts.\nCreate tables and charts for the reporting package for the monthly steering committee meeting.\nDeveloping the script required an upfront investment of a few hours, but now, updating the reporting pack for steering committee meetings or ad hoc analysis takes a matter of minutes. Literally, about 30 seconds to go to the right folder and run the script with a one-line command, and then a few minutes to copy-paste the output into the slide deck. With about 500 activities (cards) across twelve workstreams already about a month into execution, weekly tracking of how they move, inside a program timeline of two years, you quickly find yourself dealing with thousands, and eventually tens of thousands of data points across dozens of files. Without automation, we are talking about some very tedious tasks here.\n\nThe “time value of money” trade-off between just getting on with things, or adding more initial workload by setting up automation is a common theme in finance. I made a similar decision with the first step of this process, by exporting the data as CSV files. MeisterTask, like many modern web applications, has an API, which can be connected to your Python application, but the time spent setting it up would far outweigh the time savings for our use case here.\n\nSo, as you see, oftentimes the optimal solution is to automate certain steps of a workflow and keep others manual.\n\n2. Analyzing House Price Statistics Using Web Scraping, Google Maps API, and Excel\nAnother example is something I did out of personal interest but I want to highlight it because it contains some other interesting elements of Python’s utility:\n\nScrape data of real estate listings, including address, size, number of rooms, asking price, and other features, for a given area; a few hundred to perhaps a thousand lines in total.\nSave into a Python data structure.\nConnect to the Google Maps API and, for each listing, retrieve the distance between the property and key landmarks such as the sea, the city center, nearest train station, nearest airport, etc.\nExport the data to an Excel file.\nUse standard Excel functionality to run regressions, calculate statistics and create charts on standard metrics such as price per square meter and distance to landmarks.\nThe results here could be combined with your own personal weightings in terms of preferences, and financial limitations when looking for real estate.\n\nThese are only two examples, focused on automating spreadsheet-related work and adding features, but the opportunities with Python are almost endless. In the next section, I will outline the reasons why it has become so popular, before moving on to a step-by-step Monte Carlo simulation tutorial in Python.\n\nWhy Python is a Great Choice for Finance Professionals\nThe programming language Python has been around since 1990, but it is not until recent years that its popularity has exploded.\n","My introduction to programming was learning BASIC on an Oric 1 in the mid-1980s.

Despite the slow start, it’s easy to see why the finance industry and finance teams within companies are accelerating their adoption of the technology.","The most obvious benefit that AI offers to finance is its facility for reading, classifying, and extracting insights from datasets too large and complex for humans to manage effectively. That’s important: Companies usually collect massive amounts of information, even though more than two-thirds may never be used.\n\nUnlike traditional bots and automation tools, machine learning algorithms can sift through data to identify and learn from patterns, enabling them to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This is particularly useful when analyzing loan applications, for example. Until recently, JPMorganChase relied on human workers to manually review and interpret commercial loan agreements, a process that was not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, due to the complexity and volume of the documents. To address this challenge, the bank developed a contract intelligence platform called COIN. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP), a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and produce human language, COIN extracts and analyzes key information from loan documents automatically.\n\nThe implementation of COiN dramatically reduced the time required to review documents, the bank told investors. What used to take the company’s lawyers and loan officers 360,000 hours annually can now be accomplished in just seconds and with fewer errors, speeding operations without a proportional increase in overhead costs.",,,,,,,,,,,"""e5c5f0340d295cd73b8501caf981fc18""",,,,,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,,,,2024-12-10T11:05:05.769Z,,,,,,,,2024-12-10T11:05:05.769Z,,,,,,,,image/webp,,,,,,,,img-d320oqYWscvU8q8HLX0brOyX.webp,,,,,,,,211630,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/10122024163505/img-d320oqYWscvU8q8HLX0brOyX.webp,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/10122024163505/img-d320oqYWscvU8q8HLX0brOyX.webp,,,,,,,,"""e5c5f0340d295cd73b8501caf981fc18""",,,,,,,,200,,,,,,,,6DS5H553HZ1V8ZDR,,,,,,,,WJ3X1K3Egf2RYa9XVXD3xbJZGOtzATa2lCJMOcg/DyFHlTg9xbukHpZCjZ+djSoLYkPAb1VT6Fw=,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"""e5c5f0340d295cd73b8501caf981fc18""",,,,,,,,AES256,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/10122024163505/img-d320oqYWscvU8q8HLX0brOyX.webp,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/10122024163505/img-d320oqYWscvU8q8HLX0brOyX.webp,,,,,,,,img-d320oqYWscvU8q8HLX0brOyX.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,211630,,,,,,,,"\nexport async function deleteBlogSectionById(blogId: string, sectionId: string) {\n   try {\n      const db = await getAppDB();\n      const blogsCollection = db.collection(""blogs"");\n\n      const result = await blogsCollection.updateOne(\n         { _id: new ObjectId(blogId) },\n         { $pull: { blogSections: { _id: sectionId } } }\n      );\n\n      if (!result.modifiedCount) {\n         throw new Error(`Failed to delete the section with ID ${sectionId} from blog ${blogId}.`);\n      }\n      return { success: true, message: ""Section deleted successfully."" };\n   } catch (error: any) {\n      throw new Error(error?.message || ""Failed to delete the blog section."");\n   }",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67580b1db0c5736f0b04905f,67580b1db0c5736f0b049060,Musavvir,,,"""eaf2ba0f78ed3e21b52beed3c08c65c0""",BLOG_COVER_IMAGE,2024-12-10T11:22:36.864Z,2024-12-10T11:22:36.864Z,image/jpeg,1640848332598.jfif,37131,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/67581f76d1fa561a1ddf2c1d/1640848332598.jfif,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/67581f76d1fa561a1ddf2c1d/1640848332598.jfif,"""eaf2ba0f78ed3e21b52beed3c08c65c0""",200,BSWCFDVMHHE13JCW,S97QZCjcpRMFHEQUn+dd7piK9xGzkdJmG3D2YCvwkpl5oeuPmgAGvwuOsNx1iuboaIF5/swFRASf2vVKkJmY9g==,,1,0,"""eaf2ba0f78ed3e21b52beed3c08c65c0""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/67581f76d1fa561a1ddf2c1d/1640848332598.jfif,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/67581f76d1fa561a1ddf2c1d/1640848332598.jfif,1640848332598.jfif,,,37131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,43,,The finance industry is beginning to embrace the power of AI to drive productivity and increase customer satisfaction.

For these applications, the foundation LLM can be fine-tuned using smaller labeled datasets that focus on specific domains.

If you are completely new to growth marketing, a basic analysis of your current campaigns is a good starting point. Begin with a broader view of your overall campaign efficacy and then penetrate deeper into more specific data points that show how each area is impacting the customer journey.

It was initially made as a sort of a “glue” for various displayed HTML elements, known as a client-side scripting language, for one of the initial web browsers. Called Netscape Navigator, it could only display static HTML at the time. As you might assume, the idea of such a scripting language led to browser wars between the big players in the browser development industry back then, such as Netscape Communications (today Mozilla), Microsoft, and others.\n\nEach of the big players wanted to push through their own implementation of this scripting language, so Netscape made JavaScript (actually, Brendan Eich did), Microsoft made JScript, and so forth. As you can image, the differences between these implementations were great, so development for web browsers was made per-browser, with best-viewed-on stickers that came with a web page. It soon became clear that we needed a standard, a cross-browser solution which would unify the development process and simplify the creation of web pages. What they came up with is called ECMAScript.\n\nECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification which all modern browsers try to support, and there are multiple implementations (you could say dialects) of ECMAScript. The most popular one is the topic of this article, JavaScript. Since its initial release, ECMAScript has standardized a lot of important things, and for those more interested in the specifics, there is a detailed list of standardized items for each version of the ECMAScript available on Wikipedia. Browser support for ECMAScript versions 6 (ES6) and higher are still incomplete and have to be transpiled to ES5 in order to be fully supported.","In order to fully grasp the contents of this article, let’s make an introduction to some very important language characteristics that we need to be aware of before diving into JavaScript patterns. If someone were to ask you “What is JavaScript?” you might answer somewhere in the lines of:\n\nJavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented programming language with first-class functions most commonly known as a scripting language for web pages.\n\nThe aforementioned definition means to say that JavaScript code has a low memory footprint, is easy to implement, and easy to learn, with a syntax similar to popular languages such as C++ and Java. It is a scripting language, which means that its code is interpreted instead of compiled. It has support for procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles, which makes it very flexible for developers.\n\nSo far, we have taken a look at all of the characteristics which sound like many other languages out there, so let’s take a look at what is specific about JavaScript in regard to other languages. I am going to list a few characteristics and give my best shot at explaining why they deserve special attention.\n\n","This characteristic used to be troublesome for me to grasp when I was just starting with JavaScript, as I came from a C/C++ background. JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, meaning you can pass functions as parameters to other functions just like you would any other variable.\n\n","As is the case with many other object-oriented languages, JavaScript supports objects, and one of the first terms that comes to mind when thinking about objects is classes and inheritance. This is where it gets a little tricky, as the language doesn’t support classes in its plain language form but rather uses something called prototype-based or instance-based inheritance.\n\nIt is just now, in ES6, that the formal term class is introduced, which means that the browsers still don’t support this (if you remember, as of writing, the last fully supported ECMAScript version is 5.1). It is important to note, however, that even though the term “class” is introduced into JavaScript, it still utilizes prototype-based inheritance under the hood.\n\nPrototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behavior reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegations that serve as prototypes. We will dive into more detail with this once we get to the design patterns section of the article, as this characteristic is used in a lot of JS design patterns.\n\n","If you have experience working with JavaScript, you are surely familiar with the term callback function. For those not familiar with the term, a callback function is a function sent as a parameter (remember, JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens) to another function and gets executed after an event fires. This is usually used for subscribing to events such as a mouse click or a keyboard button press.\n\nEach time an event, which has a listener attached to it, fires (otherwise the event is lost), a message is being sent to a queue of messages which are being processed synchronously, in a FIFO manner (first-in-first-out). This is called the event loop.\n\nEach of the messages on the queue has a function associated with it. Once a message is dequeued, the runtime executes the function completely before processing any other message. This is to say, if a function contains other function calls, they are all performed prior to processing a new message from the queue. This is called run-to-completion.\nThe queue.waitForMessage() synchronously waits for new messages. Each of the messages being processed has its own stack and is processed until the stack is empty. Once it finishes, a new message is processed from the queue, if there is one.\n\nYou might have also heard that JavaScript is non-blocking, meaning that when an asynchronous operation is being performed, the program is able to process other things, such as receiving user input, while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete, not blocking the main execution thread. This is a very useful property of JavaScript and a whole article could be written just on this topic; however, it is outside of the scope of this article.","As I said before, design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. Let’s take a look at some of the categories of design patterns.\n\nProto-patterns\n\n\nHow does one create a pattern? Let’s say you recognized a commonly occurring problem, and you have your own unique solution to this problem, which isn’t globally recognized and documented. You use this solution every time you encounter this problem, and you think that it’s reusable and that the developer community could benefit from it.\n\nDoes it immediately become a pattern? Luckily, no. Oftentimes, one may have good code writing practices and simply mistake something that looks like a pattern for one when, in fact, it is not a pattern.\n\nHow can you know when what you think you recognize is actually a design pattern?\n\nBy getting other developers’ opinions about it, by knowing about the process of creating a pattern itself, and by making yourself well acquainted with existing patterns. There is a phase a pattern has to go through before it becomes a full-fledged pattern, and this is called a proto-pattern.\n\nA proto-pattern is a pattern-to-be if it passes a certain period of testing by various developers and scenarios where the pattern proves to be useful and gives correct results. There is quite a large amount of work and documentation—most of which is outside the scope of this article—to be done in order to make a fully-fledged pattern recognized by the community.\n\nAnti-patterns\n\n\nAs a design pattern represents good practice, an anti-pattern represents bad practice.\n\nAn example of an anti-pattern would be modifying the Object class prototype. Almost all objects in JavaScript inherit from Object (remember that JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance) so imagine a scenario where you altered this prototype. Changes to the Object prototype would be seen in all of the objects that inherit from this prototype—which would be most JavaScript objects. This is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nAnother example, similar to one mentioned above, is modifying objects that you don’t own. An example of this would be overriding a function from an object used in many scenarios throughout the application. If you are working with a large team, imagine the confusion this would cause; you’d quickly run into naming collisions, incompatible implementations, and maintenance nightmares.\n\nSimilar to how it is useful to know about all of the good practices and solutions, it is also very important to know about the bad ones too. This way, you can recognize them and avoid making the mistake up front.","Design patterns can be categorized in multiple ways, but the most popular one is the following:\n\nCreational design patterns\n\nStructural design patterns\n\nBehavioral design patterns\n\nConcurrency design patterns\n\nArchitectural design patterns","Each of the design patterns represents a specific type of solution to a specific type of problem. There is no universal set of patterns that is always the best fit. We need to learn when a particular pattern will prove useful and whether it will provide actual value. Once we are familiar with the patterns and scenarios they are best suited for, we can easily determine whether or not a specific pattern is a good fit for a given problem.\n\nRemember, applying the wrong pattern to a given problem could lead to undesirable effects such as unnecessary code complexity, unnecessary overhead on performance, or even the spawning of a new anti-pattern.\n\nThese are all important things to consider when thinking about applying a design pattern to our code. We are going to take a look at some of the design patterns in JS that every senior JavaScript developer should be familiar with.\n\nConstructor Pattern\nWhen thinking about classical object-oriented languages, a constructor is a special function in a class which initializes an object with some set of default and/or sent-in values.\n\nCommon ways to create objects in JavaScript are the three following ways:\n\n","As far as peculiarities go, JavaScript never ceases to amaze. Another peculiar thing to JavaScript (at least as far as object-oriented languages go) is that JavaScript does not support access modifiers. In a classical OOP language, a user defines a class and determines access rights for its members. Since JavaScript in its plain form supports neither classes nor access modifiers, JavaScript developers figured out a way to mimic this behavior when needed.\n\nBefore we go into the module pattern specifics, let’s talk about the concept of closure. A closure is a function with access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. They help us mimic the behavior of access modifiers through scoping. Let’s show this via an example:\n\nAs you can see, by using the IIFE, we have tied the counter variable to a function which was invoked and closed but can still be accessed by the child function that increments it. Since we cannot access the counter variable from outside of the function expression, we made it private through scoping manipulation.\n\nUsing the closures, we can create objects with private and public parts. These are called modules and are very useful whenever we want to hide certain parts of an object and only expose an interface to the user of the module. Let’s show this in an example:\n\nThe most useful thing that this pattern introduces is the clear separation of private and public parts of an object, which is a concept very similar to developers coming from a classical object-oriented background.\n\nHowever, not everything is so perfect. When you wish to change the visibility of a member, you need to modify the code wherever you have used this member because of the different nature of accessing public and private parts. Also, methods added to the object after their creation cannot access the private members of the object.","This pattern is an improvement made to the module pattern as illustrated above. The main difference is that we write the entire object logic in the private scope of the module and then simply expose the parts we want to be public by returning an anonymous object. We can also change the naming of private members when mapping private members to their corresponding public members.\n\n\n\nThe revealing module pattern is one of at least three ways in which we can implement a module pattern. The differences between the revealing module pattern and the other variants of the module pattern are primarily in how public members are referenced. As a result, the revealing module pattern is much easier to use and modify; however, it may prove fragile in certain scenarios, like using RMP objects as prototypes in an inheritance chain. The problematic situations are the following:\n\nIf we have a private function which is referring to a public function, we cannot override the public function, as the private function will continue to refer to the private implementation of the function, thus introducing a bug into our system.\nIf we have a public member pointing to a private variable, and try to override the public member from outside the module, the other functions would still refer to the private value of the variable, introducing a bug into our system.\n",,,"""6891ca53c103035866b0bd4fbacf0b2a""",,,,"""ac9070c74c6ae7747cb2fa551667d8e5""",,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,2024-12-11T01:13:30.199Z,,,,2024-12-11T01:19:09.064Z,,,,2024-12-11T01:13:30.199Z,,,,2024-12-11T01:19:09.064Z,,,,image/png,,,,image/png,,,,JavaScript-logo.png,,,,images.png,,,,25491,,,,29149,,,,hiretalentt,,,,hiretalentt,,,,blog_section_image/11122024064329/JavaScript-logo.png,,,,blog_section_image/11122024064908/images.png,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024064329/JavaScript-logo.png,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024064908/images.png,,,,"""6891ca53c103035866b0bd4fbacf0b2a""",,,,"""ac9070c74c6ae7747cb2fa551667d8e5""",,,,200,,,,200,,,,H8DMBMG5TV9DYK30,,,,5NF3WEQYTNZ76BHT,,,,PizeHYcRN5xm82D1b9d7jz37dSrmAsiIp0o6XOVL8ALpkj9+3fK0PYFdrtjUrBL4g9iM3imxuxRCRJkpmMQpYw==,,,,H1rFvGlBntY5KH/+sNT8HBsG1WvH44ixHK7xOKPR9fI8vAi3kqqu8sVffUCoS7xjAsmiVkWl4gxeu3OjS4ckOA==,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,0,,,,0,,,,"""6891ca53c103035866b0bd4fbacf0b2a""",,,,"""ac9070c74c6ae7747cb2fa551667d8e5""",,,,AES256,,,,AES256,,,,hiretalentt,,,,hiretalentt,,,,blog_section_image/11122024064329/JavaScript-logo.png,,,,blog_section_image/11122024064908/images.png,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024064329/JavaScript-logo.png,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024064908/images.png,,,,JavaScript-logo.png,,,,images.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25491,,,,29149,,,,"// Change heading:\ndocument.getElementById(""myH"").innerHTML = ""My First Page"";\n\n// Change paragraph:\ndocument.getElementById(""myP"").innerHTML = ""My first paragraph."";\n",,"// we send in the function as an argument to be\n// executed from inside the calling function\nfunction performOperation(a, b, cb) {\n    var c = a + b;\n    cb(c);\n}\n\nperformOperation(2, 3, function(result) {\n    // prints out 5\n    console.log(""The result of the operation is "" + result);\n})",,while (queue.waitForMessage()) {\n    queue.processNextMessage();\n},,,"/ either of the following ways can be used to create a new object\nvar instance = {};\n// or\nvar instance = Object.create(Object.prototype);\n// or\nvar instance = new Object();\n\n\n\nAfter creating an object, there are four ways (since ES3) to add properties to these objects. They are the following:\n\n// supported since ES3\n// the dot notation\ninstance.key = ""A key's value"";\n\n// the square brackets notation\ninstance[""key""] = ""A key's value"";\n\n// supported since ES5\n// setting a single property using Object.defineProperty\nObject.defineProperty(instance, ""key"", {\n    value: ""A key's value"",\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: true,\n    configurable: true\n});\n\n// setting multiple properties using Object.defineProperties\nObject.defineProperties(instance, {\n    ""firstKey"": {\n        value: ""First key's value"",\n        writable: true\n    },\n    ""secondKey"": {\n        value: ""Second key's value"",\n        writable: false\n    }\n});\nThe most popular way to create objects is the curly brackets and, for adding properties, the dot notation or square brackets. Anyone with any experience with JavaScript has used them.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that JavaScript doesn’t support native classes, but it does support constructors through the use of a “new” keyword prefixed to a function call. This way, we can use the function as a constructor and initialize its properties the same way we would with a classic language constructor.\n\n// we define a constructor for Person objects\nfunction Person(name, age, isDeveloper) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n    this.isDeveloper = isDeveloper || false;\n\n    this.writesCode = function() {\n      console.log(this.isDeveloper? ""This person does write code"" : ""This person does not write code"");\n    }\n}\n\n// creates a Person instance with properties name: Bob, age: 38, isDeveloper: true and a method writesCode\nvar person1 = new Person(""Bob"", 38, true);\n// creates a Person instance with properties name: Alice, age: 32, isDeveloper: false and a method writesCode\nvar person2 = new Person(""Alice"", 32);\n\n// prints out: This person does write code\nperson1.writesCode();\n// prints out: this person does not write code\nperson2.writesCode();\nHowever, there is still room for improvement here. If you’ll remember, I mentioned previously that JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance. The problem with the previous approach is that the method writesCode gets redefined for each of the instances of the Person constructor. We can avoid this by setting the method into the function prototype:\n\n// we define a constructor for Person objects\nfunction Person(name, age, isDeveloper) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n    this.isDeveloper = isDeveloper || false;\n}\n\n// we extend the function's prototype\nPerson.prototype.writesCode = function() {\n    console.log(this.isDeveloper? ""This person does write code"" : ""This person does not write code"");\n}\n\n// creates a Person instance with properties name: Bob, age: 38, isDeveloper: true and a method writesCode\nvar person1 = new Person(""Bob"", 38, true);\n// creates a Person instance with properties name: Alice, age: 32, isDeveloper: false and a method writesCode\nvar person2 = new Person(""Alice"", 32);\n\n// prints out: This person does write code\nperson1.writesCode();\n// prints out: this person does not write code\nperson2.writesCode();","/ we  used an immediately invoked function expression\n// to create a private variable, counter\nvar counterIncrementer = (function() {\n    var counter = 0;\n\n    return function() {\n        return ++counter;\n    };\n})();\n\n// prints out 1\nconsole.log(counterIncrementer());\n// prints out 2\nconsole.log(counterIncrementer());\n// prints out 3\nconsole.log(counterIncrementer());\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// through the use of a closure we expose an object\n// as a public API which manages the private objects array\nvar collection = (function() {\n    // private members\n    var objects = [];\n\n    // public members\n    return {\n        addObject: function(object) {\n            objects.push(object);\n        },\n        removeObject: function(object) {\n            var index = objects.indexOf(object);\n            if (index >= 0) {\n                objects.splice(index, 1);\n            }\n        },\n        getObjects: function() {\n            return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(objects));\n        }\n    };\n})();\n\ncollection.addObject(""Bob"");\ncollection.addObject(""Alice"");\ncollection.addObject(""Franck"");\n// prints [""Bob"", ""Alice"", ""Franck""]\nconsole.log(collection.getObjects());\ncollection.removeObject(""Alice"");\n// prints [""Bob"", ""Franck""]\nconsole.log(collection.getObjects());","// we write the entire object logic as private members and\n// expose an anonymous object which maps members we wish to reveal\n// to their corresponding public members\nvar namesCollection = (function() {\n    // private members\n    var objects = [];\n\n    function addObject(object) {\n        objects.push(object);\n    }\n\n    function removeObject(object) {\n        var index = objects.indexOf(object);\n        if (index >= 0) {\n            objects.splice(index, 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    function getObjects() {\n        return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(objects));\n    }\n\n    // public members\n    return {\n        addName: addObject,\n        removeName: removeObject,\n        getNames: getObjects\n    };\n})();\n\nnamesCollection.addName(""Bob"");\nnamesCollection.addName(""Alice"");\nnamesCollection.addName(""Franck"");\n// prints [""Bob"", ""Alice"", ""Franck""]\nconsole.log(namesCollection.getNames());\nnamesCollection.removeName(""Alice"");\n// prints [""Bob"", ""Franck""]\nconsole.log(namesCollection.getNames());\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,675814a0b0c5736f0b049062,675814a0b0c5736f0b049063,Usama,,,"""6891ca53c103035866b0bd4fbacf0b2a""",BLOG_COVER_IMAGE,2024-12-11T01:10:50.929Z,2024-12-11T01:10:50.929Z,image/png,JavaScript-logo.png,25491,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/6758e660d62bb61927309162/JavaScript-logo.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/6758e660d62bb61927309162/JavaScript-logo.png,"""6891ca53c103035866b0bd4fbacf0b2a""",200,XY4AMVMS8EF5J1EQ,oWK3f5u0SiEnYeXsL2NcdYTpnTVu2tvGrS9zudQzVLcB07lFOvNlXhvRCp6RAAzdDGSc6LR+9pI=,,1,0,"""6891ca53c103035866b0bd4fbacf0b2a""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/6758e660d62bb61927309162/JavaScript-logo.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/6758e660d62bb61927309162/JavaScript-logo.png,JavaScript-logo.png,,,25491,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They enable software to communicate with other pieces of software—internal or external—consistently, which is a key ingredient in scalability, not to mention reusability.\n\nIt’s quite common nowadays for online services to have public-facing APIs. These enable other developers to easily integrate features like social media logins, credit card payments, and behavior tracking. The de facto standard they use for this is called representational state transfer (REST).\n\nAnd why build a Node.js REST API, in particular? While a multitude of platforms and programming languages can be used for the task—like ASP.NET Core, Laravel (PHP), or Bottle (Python)—JavaScript remains the most popular language among professional developers. So in this tutorial, our basic but secure REST API back end will focus on components common among JavaScript developers:\n\nNode.js, which the reader should already have some familiarity with.\nExpress.js, which vastly simplifies building out common web server tasks and is standard fare in building a Node.js REST API back end.\nMongoose, which will connect our back end to a MongoDB database.\nDevelopers following this tutorial should also be comfortable with the terminal (or command prompt).\n\nNote: We won’t cover a front-end codebase here, but the fact that our back end is written in JavaScript makes it convenient to share code—object models, for instance—throughout the full stack.","REST APIs are used to access and manipulate data using a common set of stateless operations. These operations are integral to the HTTP protocol and represent essential create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality, although not in a clean one-to-one manner:\n\nPOST (create a resource or generally provide data)\nGET (retrieve an index of resources or an individual resource)\nPUT (create or replace a resource)\nPATCH (update/modify a resource)\nDELETE (remove a resource)\nUsing these HTTP operations and a resource name as an address, we can build a Node.js REST API by creating an endpoint for each operation. And by implementing the pattern, we will have a stable and easily understandable foundation enabling us to evolve the code rapidly and maintain it afterward. The same foundation will be used to integrate third-party features, most of which likewise use REST APIs, making such integration faster.\n\nFor now, let’s start creating our secure Node.js REST API.\n\nIn this tutorial, we are going to create a pretty common (and very practical) secure REST API for a resource called users.\n\nOur resource will have the following basic structure:\n\nid (an auto-generated UUID)\nfirstName\nlastName\nemail\npassword\npermissionLevel (what is this user allowed to do?)\nAnd we will create the following operations for that resource:\n\nPOST on the endpoint /users (create a new user)\nGET on the endpoint /users (list all users)\nGET on the endpoint /users/:userId (get a specific user)\nPATCH on the endpoint /users/:userId (update the data for a specific user)\nDELETE on the endpoint /users/:userId (remove a specific user)\nWe will also be using JSON web tokens (JWTs) for access tokens. To that end, we will create another resource called auth that will expect a user’s email and password and, in return, will generate the token used for authentication on certain operations. (Dejan Milosevic’s great article on JWT for secure REST applications in Java goes into further detail about this; the principles are the same.)\n\n","First, make sure that you have the latest Node.js version installed. For this article, I’ll be using version 14.9.0; it may also work on older versions.\n\nNext, make sure that you have MongoDB installed. We won’t explain the specifics of Mongoose and MongoDB that are used here, but to get the basics running, simply start the server in interactive mode (i.e., from the command line as mongo) rather than as a service. That’s because, at one point in this tutorial, we’ll need to interact with MongoDB directly rather than via our Node.js code.\n\nNote: With MongoDB, there’s no need to create a specific database like there might be in some RDBMS scenarios. The first insert call from our Node.js code will trigger its creation automatically.\n\nThis tutorial does not contain all of the code necessary for a working project. It’s intended instead that you clone the companion repo and simply follow along the highlights as you read through. But you can also copy in specific files and snippets from the repo as needed, if you prefer.\n\nNavigate to the resulting rest-api-tutorial/ folder in your terminal. You’ll see that our project contains three module folders:\n\ncommon (handling all shared services, and information shared between user modules)\nusers (everything regarding users)\nauth (handling JWT generation and the login flow)\nNow, run npm install (or yarn if you have it).\n\nCongratulations! You now have all of the dependencies and setup required to run our simple Node.js REST API back end.\n\n","We will be using Mongoose, an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, to create the user model within the user schema.\n\nFirst, we need to create the Mongoose schema in /users/models/users.model.js:\n\n",,,,,,,,,,,,"""e010a8d93bf5e37f802e308ff5b58bf2""",,,,,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,,,,2024-12-13T05:52:50.897Z,,,,,,,,2024-12-13T05:52:50.897Z,,,,,,,,image/avif,,,,,,,,images (1).avif,,,,,,,,6695,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/13122024112250/images (1).avif,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024112250/images (1).avif,,,,,,,,"""e010a8d93bf5e37f802e308ff5b58bf2""",,,,,,,,200,,,,,,,,VKZXXK1V12Z05M8F,,,,,,,,Uqd8NYMnFVs4wWWtYB7TaSCRWGWMPwRFl1eFeLxa8p30d+g8KstJ5HiORtFQIn0JBuj1RuuPbhm/Vruzmpicnw==,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"""e010a8d93bf5e37f802e308ff5b58bf2""",,,,,,,,AES256,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/13122024112250/images (1).avif,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024112250/images%20%281%29.avif,,,,,,,,images (1).avif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6695,,,,,,,,"const userSchema = new Schema({\n   firstName: String,\n   lastName: String,\n   email: String,\n   password: String,\n   permissionLevel: Number\n});\n\n\n\n\n\nconst userSchema = new Schema({\n   firstName: String,\n   lastName: String,\n   email: String,\n   password: String,\n   permissionLevel: Number\n});\nOnce we define the schema, we can easily attach the schema to the user model.\n\nconst userModel = mongoose.model('Users', userSchema);\nAfter that, we can use this model to implement all the CRUD operations that we want within our Express.js endpoints.\n\nLet’s start with the “create user” operation by defining the Express.js route in users/routes.config.js:\n\napp.post('/users', [\n   UsersController.insert\n]);\nThis is pulled into our Express.js app in the main index.js file. The UsersController object is imported from our controller, where we hash the password appropriately, defined in /users/controllers/users.controller.js:\n\nexports.insert = (req, res) => {\n   let salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64');\n   let hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512',salt)\n                                    .update(req.body.password)\n                                    .digest(""base64"");\n   req.body.password = salt + ""$"" + hash;\n   req.body.permissionLevel = 1;\n   UserModel.createUser(req.body)\n       .then((result) => {\n           res.status(201).send({id: result._id});\n       });\n};\nAt this point, we can test our Mongoose model by running the Node.js API server (npm start) and sending a POST request to /users with some JSON data:\n\n{\n   ""firstName"" : ""Marcos"",\n   ""lastName"" : ""Silva"",\n   ""email"" : ""marcos.henrique@toptal.com"",\n   ""password"" : ""s3cr3tp4sswo4rd""\n}\nThere are several tools you can use for this. We cover Insomnia below, but you can also use Postman or open-source alternatives like cURL (a command-line tool) or Bruno. You can even just use JavaScript—for example, from your browser’s built-in development tools console—like so:\n\nfetch('http://localhost:3600/users', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n            ""Content-type"": ""application/json""\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({\n            ""firstName"": ""Marcos"",\n            ""lastName"": ""Silva"",\n            ""email"": ""marcos.henrique@toptal.com"",\n            ""password"": ""s3cr3tp4sswo4rd""\n        })\n    })\n    .then(function(response) {\n        return response.json();\n    })\n    .then(function(data) {\n        console.log('Request succeeded with JSON response', data);\n    })\n    .catch(function(error) {\n        console.log('Request failed', error);\n    });\nAt this point, the result of a valid post will be just the ID from the created user: { ""id"": ""5b02c5c84817bf28049e58a3"" }. We need to also add the createUser method to the model in users/models/users.model.js:\n\nexports.createUser = (userData) => {\n    const user = new User(userData);\n    return user.save();\n};\nNow we need to see if the user exists. For that, we are going to implement the “get user by id” feature for the users/:userId endpoint.\n\nFirst, we create an Express.js route in /users/routes/config.js:\n\napp.get('/users/:userId', [\n    UsersController.getById\n]);\nThen, we create the controller in /users/controllers/users.controller.js:\n\nexports.getById = (req, res) => {\n   UserModel.findById(req.params.userId).then((result) => {\n       res.status(200).send(result);\n   });\n};\nAnd finally, add the findById method to the model in /users/models/users.model.js:\n\nexports.findById = (id) => {\n    return User.findById(id).then((result) => {\n        result = result.toJSON();\n        delete result._id;\n        delete result.__v;\n        return result;\n    });\n};\nThe response will look like this:\n\n{\n   ""firstName"": ""Marcos"",\n   ""lastName"": ""Silva"",\n   ""email"": ""marcos.henrique@toptal.com"",\n   ""password"": ""Y+XZEaR7J8xAQCc37nf1rw==$p8b5ykUx6xpC6k8MryDaRmXDxncLumU9mEVabyLdpotO66Qjh0igVOVerdqAh+CUQ4n/E0z48mp8SDTpX2ivuQ=="",\n   ""permissionLevel"": 1,\n   ""id"": ""5b02c5c84817bf28049e58a3""\n}\nNote that we can see the hashed password. For this tutorial, we are showing the password, but the best practice is never to reveal the password, even if it has been hashed. Another thing we can see is the permissionLevel, which we will use to handle the user permissions later on.\n\nRepeating the pattern laid out above, we can now add the functionality to update the user. We will use the PATCH operation since it will enable us to send only the fields we want to change. The Express.js route will, therefore, be PATCH to /users/:userid, and we’ll be sending any fields we want to change. We will also need to implement some extra validation since changes should be restricted to the user in question or an admin, and only an admin should be able to change the permissionLevel. We’ll skip that for now and get back to it once we implement the auth module. For now, our controller will look like this:\n\nexports.patchById = (req, res) => {\n   if (req.body.password){\n       let salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64');\n       let hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512', salt).update(req.body.password).digest(""base64"");\n       req.body.password = salt + ""$"" + hash;\n   }\n   UserModel.patchUser(req.params.userId, req.body).then((result) => {\n           res.status(204).send({});\n   });\n};\nBy default, we will send an HTTP code 204 with no response body to indicate that the request was successful.\n\nAnd we’ll need to add the patchUser method to the model:\n\nexports.patchUser = (id, userData) => {\n    return User.findOneAndUpdate({\n        _id: id\n    }, userData);\n};\nThe following controller will implement the user list as a GET at /users/:\n\nexports.list = (req, res) => {\n   let limit = req.query.limit && req.query.limit <= 100 ? parseInt(req.query.limit) : 10;\n   let page = 0;\n   if (req.query) {\n       if (req.query.page) {\n           req.query.page = parseInt(req.query.page);\n           page = Number.isInteger(req.query.page) ? req.query.page : 0;\n       }\n   }\n   UserModel.list(limit, page).then((result) => {\n       res.status(200).send(result);\n   })\n};\nThe corresponding model method will be:\n\nexports.list = (perPage, page) => {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        User.find()\n            .limit(perPage)\n            .skip(perPage * page)\n            .exec(function (err, users) {\n                if (err) {\n                    reject(err);\n                } else {\n                    resolve(users);\n                }\n            })\n    });\n};\nThe resulting list response will have the following structure:\n\n[\n   {\n       ""firstName"": ""Marco"",\n       ""lastName"": ""Silva"",\n       ""email"": ""marcos.henrique@toptal.com"",\n       ""password"": ""z4tS/DtiH+0Gb4J6QN1K3w==$al6sGxKBKqxRQkDmhnhQpEB6+DQgDRH2qr47BZcqLm4/fphZ7+a9U+HhxsNaSnGB2l05Oem/BLIOkbtOuw1tXA=="",\n       ""permissionLevel"": 1,\n       ""id"": ""5b02c5c84817bf28049e58a3""\n   },\n   {\n       ""firstName"": ""Paulo"",\n       ""lastName"": ""Silva"",\n       ""email"": ""marcos.henrique2@toptal.com"",\n       ""password"": ""wTsqO1kHuVisfDIcgl5YmQ==$cw7RntNrNBNw3MO2qLbx959xDvvrDu4xjpYfYgYMxRVDcxUUEgulTlNSBJjiDtJ1C85YimkMlYruU59rx2zbCw=="",\n       ""permissionLevel"": 1,\n       ""id"": ""5b02d038b653603d1ca69729""\n   }\n]\nAnd the last part to be implemented is the DELETE at /users/:userId.\n\nOur controller for deletion will be:\n\nexports.removeById = (req, res) => {\n   UserModel.removeById(req.params.userId)\n       .then((result)=>{\n           res.status(204).send({});\n       });\n};\nSame as before, the controller will return HTTP code 204 and no content body as confirmation.\n\nThe corresponding model method should look like this:\n\nexports.removeById = (userId) => {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        User.deleteMany({_id: userId}, (err) => {\n            if (err) {\n                reject(err);\n            } else {\n                resolve(err);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n};\nWe now have all the necessary operations for manipulating the user resource, and we’re done with the user controller. The main idea of this code is to give you the core concepts of using the REST pattern. We’ll need to return to this code to implement some validations and permissions to it, but first we’ll need to start building our security. Let’s create the auth module.\n\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,675814a0b0c5736f0b049062,675814a0b0c5736f0b049063,Usama,,,"""37e855e796501647d753f3286d6923ac""",BLOG_COVER_IMAGE,2024-12-11T01:37:30.492Z,2024-12-11T01:37:30.492Z,image/avif,images2.avif,26320,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/6758ec94d62bb61927309163/images2.avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/6758ec94d62bb61927309163/images2.avif,"""37e855e796501647d753f3286d6923ac""",200,8EXE6PMEJXCCA6YP,Dn1hXIKqhZa8hk9GUZwe9L4dsQTEN7Km0CTtdmz1y82SG4GM/jBEVlhF2EzF+pGTM4BVzXfUolI=,,1,0,"""37e855e796501647d753f3286d6923ac""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/6758ec94d62bb61927309163/images2.avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/6758ec94d62bb61927309163/images2.avif,images2.avif,,,26320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,107,,"As patterns go, REST APIs are so useful and ubiquitous that every web developer, regardless of language or platform, should know how to build them.\n\nIn this article, Toptal JavaScript Developer Marcos Henrique da Silva shows how to create a simple and secure REST API for user management on Node.js.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supervised learning relies on labeled training data, which presents input data points associated with correct output labels. The model learns a mapping from input features to output labels, enabling it to make predictions when presented with unseen input data. This is in contrast with unsupervised learning, where unlabeled data is analyzed in search of hidden patterns or data groupings. With reinforcement learning, the training follows a trial-and-error process, with humans involved mainly in the feedback stage.\n\nMost modern machine learning models are trained via supervised learning. Because high-quality training data is so important, it must be considered at each step of the training pipeline, and data labeling plays a vital role in this process.","Before designing and building a data labeling architecture, all of the data types that will be labeled must be identified. Data can come in many different forms, including text, images, video, and audio. Each data type comes with its own unique challenges, requiring a distinct approach for accurate and consistent labeling. Additionally, some data labeling software includes annotation tools geared toward specific data types. Many annotators and annotation teams also specialize in labeling certain data types. The choice of software and team will depend on the project.\n\nFor example, the data labeling process for computer vision might include categorizing digital images and videos, and creating bounding boxes to annotate the objects within them. Waymo’s Open Dataset is a publicly available example of a labeled computer vision dataset for autonomous driving; it was labeled by a combination of private and crowdsourced data labelers. Other applications for computer vision include medical imaging, surveillance and security, and augmented reality.","The labeling pipeline begins with data collection and storage. Information can be gathered manually through techniques such as interviews, surveys, or questionnaires, or collected in an automated manner via web scraping. If you don’t have the resources to collect data at scale, open-source datasets from platforms such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Google Dataset Search, and GitHub are a good alternative. Additionally, data sources can be artificially generated using mathematical models to augment real-world data. To store data, cloud platforms such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage scale with your needs, providing virtually unlimited storage capacity, and offer built-in security features. However, if you are working with highly sensitive data with regulatory compliance requirements, on-premise storage is typically required.",,,,,,,,,,"""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""","""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""",,,,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,,,2024-12-11T06:12:53.937Z,2024-12-11T06:14:59.222Z,,,,,,,2024-12-11T06:12:53.937Z,2024-12-11T06:14:59.222Z,,,,,,,image/avif,image/avif,,,,,,,images (10).avif,images (10).avif,,,,,,,49455,49455,,,,,,,hiretalentt,hiretalentt,,,,,,,blog_section_image/11122024114253/images (10).avif,blog_section_image/11122024114458/images (10).avif,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024114253/images (10).avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024114458/images (10).avif,,,,,,,"""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""","""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""",,,,,,,200,200,,,,,,,CMAM6EFZV8V03YM4,P9P2816HGSK3ASXZ,,,,,,,FtirNhLnOsW+81c5VD7cbTyZqZPNSZlBFp6CnQ0j6IKJ90KINb81VyguOahkboG+RMmrUfkbsWkfw3mbKRnkSg==,E0RA6KS3DcjlTlPOMGictd/3XHPP/bpZ3h4gQcuoazdx3XoI29eGOsSd0K++4lWlRB+tlvtDV9Q=,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,"""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""","""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""",,,,,,,AES256,AES256,,,,,,,hiretalentt,hiretalentt,,,,,,,blog_section_image/11122024114253/images (10).avif,blog_section_image/11122024114458/images (10).avif,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024114253/images%20%2810%29.avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/11122024114458/images%20%2810%29.avif,,,,,,,images (10).avif,images (10).avif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49455,49455,,,,,,,,"export const getFilteredBlogs = async ({\n   page,\n   size,\n   filterModel,\n}: {\n   page?: number;\n   size?: number;\n   filterModel?: BlogFilterModel;\n} = {}) => {\n   const user = await getSignedInUser();\n\n   let userId: string | undefined;\n   let businessId: string | undefined;\n\n   switch (filterModel?.blogType) {\n      case BlogType.MY_BLOGS:\n         userId = user?.userId;\n         break;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6757f777b0c5736f0b049059,6757f777b0c5736f0b04905a,Ayan,,,"""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""",BLOG_COVER_IMAGE,2024-12-11T06:13:11.678Z,2024-12-11T06:13:11.678Z,image/avif,images (10).avif,49455,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/67592c9da15be3605522840b/images (10).avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/67592c9da15be3605522840b/images (10).avif,"""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""",200,9A3N6YKYJ7JQQ0WB,thoPRTYu+X2/Eb4KodTJ/WkZ0HqvMjZ4yfIVU+hGp/yqtcchwDJwAaQ9h+TWU0L4SSNLoIfRmKQ=,,1,0,"""31b68ae98c202412d6959029b32b8013""",AES256,hiretalentt,blog_cover_image/67592c9da15be3605522840b/images (10).avif,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_cover_image/67592c9da15be3605522840b/images%20%2810%29.avif,images (10).avif,,,49455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,51,,"The training of machine learning models generally falls into three categories: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning relies on labeled training data, which presents input data points associated with correct output labels. The model learns a mapping from input features to output labels, enabling it to make predictions when presented with unseen input data. This is in contrast with unsupervised learning, where unlabeled data is analyzed in search of hidden patterns or data groupings. With reinforcement learning, the training follows a trial-and-error process, with humans involved mainly in the feedback stage. Most modern machine learning models are trained via supervised learning. Because high-quality training data is so important, it must be considered at each step of the training pipeline, and data labeling plays a vital role in this process.\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trust is now a matter of brand equity: More than two-thirds of consumers in a recent Edelman survey said that being able to trust brands is more important today than in the past.\n\nMarketing content can be a key driver of trust as it is often the first contact a consumer will have with a brand. Over several years as a digital marketer and content manager, I’ve watched a multitude of companies throw piles of money at online advertising platforms, trying and failing to engage prospective customers. This led me to design a content marketing framework to help businesses organically attract more customers via their online presence. The four pillars of what I call the REAL framework are Relationships, Education, Amusement, and Lead Magnets. Each pillar provides content guidelines and actionable steps that, when combined, will help you drive sustainable, organic growth through your marketing.\n\nSixty-eight percent of respondents said brand trust has increased in importance; 88% said that trust is a critical factor when choosing a brand.\n","1. Relationships: Build an Authentic Online Presence\nIt’s common sense that people are more likely to trust those they know and like, which is why building relationships with your potential customers is the foundation of successful online marketing. Engaging with them on social media is the most effective way to do this.\n\nTo build an authentic online presence:\n\nGet real: Channel your genuine voice in all your social media content, share your stories, and respond to people in the comments section.\n\nBuild community: Host online events and create virtual spaces for people to connect, like a Facebook group.\n\nShow off: Post customer testimonials, showcase industry recognition or awards, and celebrate follower milestones.\n\nDon’t spread yourself too thin by trying to cover every social media platform. It can be more effective to focus on one or two where your target audience is most active. A strong social media presence will prime your audience to engage with your other content, such as thought leadership.\n\n2. Education: Become a Thought Leader\nWhen you educate people, you’re not just sharing information—you’re positioning yourself as an expert. You’re also letting your audience know that you’re looking out for their best interests and are there to help. Educated customers understand the value of what you’re offering; they’re not just buying a product or service, they’re buying a solution to their problem.\n\nTo successfully educate your audience:\n\nDevelop an editorial calendar: Share valuable content regularly through blog posts, videos, or social posts—consistency is key here.\n\nKeep it relevant: Tailor your content to your intended audience’s needs and interests, and incorporate appropriate target keywords to grow organic traffic. Be sure to balance timely content with evergreen content.\n\nEstablish yourself as a thought leader: Conduct original research or surveys and publish your findings in reports or white papers, write guest blog posts for publications, and sign up to speak at conferences or other networking events. Connect and collaborate with fellow industry experts where possible.\n\nAbove all, concentrate on providing value, not just making a sale. Users are savvy and it is usually obvious to them when a piece of content is a sales pitch. Deloitte’s Global Impact Reports are a great example of knowledge sharing: In these yearly reports, the company shares original research that offers valuable industry insights for businesses in the financial industry.\n\nBy consistently delivering relevant content and positioning yourself as a thought leader, you’ll build trust with your audience, making them more likely to engage with you and become a customer.\n\n3. Amusement: Delight and Engage\nBeing amusing might seem at odds with being educational, but the two approaches are not mutually exclusive, particularly in social media marketing. The key is to strike a balance—use a conversational tone, and even humor, in your social media posts, videos, and ads to make your educational content more memorable, relatable, and digestible. People are more likely to stop scrolling, engage with, and share your content if it entertains them.\n\nTo develop high-quality content that delights and engages your target audience:\n\nIncorporate personality or humor: When explaining a complex concept, find an entertaining way to present it. On social media, post memes or GIFs that are relevant to your industry. If you really want to get creative, make one of your own.\n\nEncourage participation: Host live Q&A sessions, create interactive content like quizzes or polls, or run a giveaway or contest.\n\nUse narrative techniques: Tell stories, analogies, or even jokes to illustrate your points. Utilize the hero’s journey framework and place your audience at the center.\n\nBlending education with entertainment can be challenging but will ultimately help you create engaging, valuable content that informs your readers and increases the likelihood of them remembering your brand and sharing your message.\n\n4. Lead Magnets: Attract With Value\nA lead magnet is a powerful tool that lowers the barrier to entry, as it’s low risk for the customer. Consider a sample at the grocery store—it gives customers a taste, and if it’s good, they may end up making a purchase. The offer of a free e-book, webinar, or tool in exchange for a potential customer’s contact details is an example of a digital lead magnet. It leverages reciprocity: When you give something valuable, people will be more inclined to pay attention to future posts or other content. It also provides you with a direct line of communication with prospective customers.\n\nWorking on the perfect lead magnet is how I spend the most valuable time with my clients. We figure out who the ideal customer is, what their pain points are, and how we can create a digital asset that will attract them.\n\nTo create effective lead magnets:\n\nGet creative: It doesn’t have to be an e-book, webinar, or learning tool; it could be free product trials, a template, or a checklist. Run A/B testing on different assets until you find one that’s effective.\n\nOptimize delivery: Implement a pop-up on your website or create a clear and appealing landing page to link to.\n\nNurture high-quality leads: Consider the customer journey: Segment email addresses for a more personalized approach, design compelling email campaigns that guide customers through the sales funnel, and continue to offer value via exclusive content (as well as disseminating information about new products or services) to keep them engaged.\n\nGiving something away for free is a powerful, tried-and-true way to build your email list, showcase your expertise, and start meaningful relationships with potential customers.\n\n","This versatile content framework can be tailored to suit your specific industry, business objectives, and audience segments. Here are some of the most common business use cases and tips for getting the most out of the framework in those sectors:\n\n1. Software as a service\n\nUse educational blog posts to explain particularly complex or technical features.\nCreate video content to showcase the pain points your software solves.\nOffer free trials as lead magnets so that customers can experience the product.\n2. Financial services\n\nBuild trust through authoritative, jargon-free educational content, such as industry white papers.\nShare relatable customer success stories and be as detailed as possible about the revenue increases these customers experienced.\nDevelop an interactive calculator or financial assessment tool to use as a lead magnet.\n3. Consulting\n\nDemonstrate your expertise via in-depth case studies.\nCreate long-form videos that showcase your brand identity, so customers have a sense of who you are; share product demos or provide guidance for the services you are offering.\nOffer free consultations or strategy sessions as lead magnets.\n4. E-commerce\n\nLet your existing customers market for you by encouraging user-generated content, such as a “photo of the week” from users that features your product.\nUse videos to educate customers on product uses and benefits, and on how to get the most out of what you’re selling.\nUse discount codes or exclusive offers as lead magnets.\nWhatever the nature of your content efforts, be consistent with the output. Social media platforms and search engine algorithms value consistency, which means greater visibility for your posts; consistency also trains your audience to expect and consume your content on a regular basis.\n\n","Just as important as consistency is monitoring the efficacy of your content marketing efforts. Develop specific content goals, look at what’s working well and what’s falling flat, and adjust your content strategy accordingly.

Consider Spotify, a global leader in the music streaming industry with more than 626 million users. Spotify’s success can be attributed to its meticulous product design approach, which is based on user-centric design, data-driven decision-making, and a commitment to continuous improvement.\n\nBy contrast, a weak product design process can significantly harm the user experience, functionality, and overall success of a product or service—failed product launches can cost companies millions, or billions, in direct losses, stock drops, and public sentiment.\n\nProduct designers are pivotal in crafting compelling and successful digital products that accommodate business needs and key user preferences. They expertly carry out user research, ideation, testing, and iterative processes to create immersive and enjoyable digital experiences tailored to a particular customer segment.\n\nAs a senior product designer with extensive experience in B2B, B2C, and SaaS enterprise solutions, I have worked with various product design processes throughout my career.

Its latest release included extensive UI updates, giving users more control over their workspace. Adobe XD is no longer available for purchase as a standalone application, but still supports existing users in “maintenance mode,” and continues to offer integration across the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. Sketch is the application of choice for many designers using Mac, valued for its screen design focus and plugin range. Version 100, an important update released earlier this year, saw important improvements to its interactive prototyping capabilities.\n\nThere isn’t necessarily one tool that’s best for all design projects, but a detailed feature comparison can be invaluable when selecting the right design platform. Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch each offer a distinct set of capabilities that can cater to specific design needs—let’s explore how they compare.\n\n","Figma’s UI includes a central canvas, a toolbar, and dedicated panels for layers, properties, and assets. Users can also choose between light and dark modes for visual comfort. One of the main objectives of Figma UI3, the third redesign of the Figma interface launched earlier in 2024, was to provide a more focused and approachable design environment for users. The UI3 updates include a more intuitive UI with informative labels in the properties panel (including an explanation of what each property does and which can be turned on and off), and resizable and collapsible panels, which aim to give users more control over their workspace. Unlike its competitors, Figma is accessible entirely in a browser, allowing for platform independence and reducing the barrier to entry for new users.",,"Figma has a comprehensive component and style library, a centralized hub for designers to store and manage reusable elements across projects and teams. Users can create reusable objects known as components, such as buttons, icons, and input fields, as well as more complex items like device mockups, platform OS components, and company logos. Additionally, the rollout of UI3 brought users 200 new icons hand-drawn by Figma designer Tim Van Damm. Styles and variables play a key role in making Figma a powerhouse for maintaining consistency across design files. Styles are predefined attributes (such as font, size, weight etc.) that can be applied to components, while variables enable designers to define and modify properties across multiple instances and create dynamic and easily updatable components across multiple artboards.",,,,,,,,,"""28143b8319ea539d8427b095cc217f49""","""28143b8319ea539d8427b095cc217f49""",,"""48c0f556071a990b682bdab013cef6d9""",,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,2024-12-13T09:27:38.168Z,2024-12-13T09:29:27.954Z,,2024-12-13T09:31:12.142Z,,,,,2024-12-13T09:27:38.168Z,2024-12-13T09:29:27.954Z,,2024-12-13T09:31:12.142Z,,,,,image/png,image/png,,image/png,,,,,Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,,Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11.12.03 AM.png,,,,,549050,549050,,741437,,,,,hiretalentt,hiretalentt,,hiretalentt,,,,,blog_section_image/13122024145737/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,blog_section_image/13122024145927/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,,blog_section_image/13122024150111/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11.12.03 AM.png,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024145737/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024145927/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024150111/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11.12.03 AM.png,,,,,"""28143b8319ea539d8427b095cc217f49""","""28143b8319ea539d8427b095cc217f49""",,"""48c0f556071a990b682bdab013cef6d9""",,,,,200,200,,200,,,,,D8P5G3PN8Y30FG66,X4P0MQKNQ9DG42XJ,,THKZF9S9MWFERFS1,,,,,TVLme6NoWdwIi7lcbS79JKeAp0b7y61YS7tHjVbixFU+xr6+VgHjaBvKhpnFloHRKN6bNR8fFYU=,AaHNXIl5yfXy7rVC8F68Ru+AI+CCR6nmrELEpefKdBPHFVS69ZFfQ/a8nf8zE+8dGGex0GaATdU=,,uWqqucSqAHRSx14lg7yqXqygykT31mO9yyVACFaY9g1AlBZ2YRXRDDLjdeWEvUzTr4Gd3bgdxABa4Jm3cdRuJw==,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,1,,,,,0,0,,0,,,,,"""28143b8319ea539d8427b095cc217f49""","""28143b8319ea539d8427b095cc217f49""",,"""48c0f556071a990b682bdab013cef6d9""",,,,,AES256,AES256,,AES256,,,,,hiretalentt,hiretalentt,,hiretalentt,,,,,blog_section_image/13122024145737/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,blog_section_image/13122024145927/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,,blog_section_image/13122024150111/Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11.12.03 AM.png,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024145737/Screenshot%202024-12-12%20at%207.29.15%20PM.png,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024145927/Screenshot%202024-12-12%20at%207.29.15%20PM.png,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/13122024150111/Screenshot%202024-12-12%20at%2011.12.03%20AM.png,,,,,Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 7.29.15 PM.png,,Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11.12.03 AM.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,549050,549050,,741437,,,,,console,system,(print),style,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6757f777b0c5736f0b049059,6757f777b0c5736f0b04905a,Ayan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, Gmail has a star icon users can click to mark their important emails. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a similar star so that users can click or tap to mark items they like. The resulting animation will be quite simple—a subtle fade from white to blue—but it is minor details like these that make a product more engaging.","On the toolbar at the top of the screen (we’ll call this the top toolbar), click the shape tool—a square icon—on the left side to access the drop-down menu. Select the star from the menu and then click to draw the shape in your canvas. You should now have a gray star on your canvas.\n\nOnce you create the shape, a panel where you can customize the element’s angle, size, color, and effect opens on the right sidebar. Adjust the settings: Click the minus sign in the fill field to remove the gray fill, and choose the stroke color you want for the shape’s outline (I set mine to blue for this tutorial). You can also adjust the line’s thickness by changing the number next to the hamburger icon (I set mine to 2).","Click on the star, and then click Create component (the diamond icon) on the top toolbar to turn the star into a component.","To preview the animation, you first need to create a frame. Start by clicking the region tool on the left side of the top toolbar and choosing Frame from the drop-down menu.

Make Process Policies Explicit,Identify Other Improvement Opportunities,Enhance Your Team’s Workflow Efficiency,Understanding the basicsn,,,,,,"When left unmanaged, the impact of frequent context switching on both teams and organizations can be extensive. In addition to reduced productivity, there are a range of other potential negative effects. The pressure to meet deadlines coupled with a diminished ability to focus can lead to more errors and lower-quality work overall, which in turn promotes a project mindset that prioritizes output rather than customer value. Team members can end up dealing with failure demand—the additional work generated when the delivered work does not meet the product goals—instead of focusing on value demand—the work done that generates value. This can have dire consequences for businesses, including the loss of users, clients, and revenue. All of this can lead to lower compensation, fewer perks, and a more toxic work culture, resulting in low morale.","Setting limits around the amount of work in progress helps facilitate a continuous flow of work and ensures team members don’t take on too much at once. This practice is built on a principle of Lean thinking called the pull system, which recommends only starting work if there is capacity to complete it. As well as reducing the need to context switch, using this decision-making process can ensure developers are not overburdened and can focus on quality.\n\nImplementing work-in-progress limits encourages developers to think about their workload more holistically. For example, their limit for one week may be to code two product features and handle two code review requests.","The goal of Kanban is to create a predictable flow of work, and this can also help developers better anticipate and plan for context switching. Flow metrics like cycle time—the time it takes for tasks to move through the workflow stages—can be hugely valuable.\n\nFor example, measure the time it takes for 10 tasks to move from the Code in Progress workflow stage to the Peer Review stage, and calculate the 70th percentile. Over 10 tasks, let’s say the completion time in days was: 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. The 70th percentile is four days, meaning that 70% of the tasks were completed within four days, and there is a 30% risk of delay. I find that the 70th percentile works well, but you may want to have less risk involved, and choose the 80th or 90th percentile. Measure the average cycle time for each workflow stage.",Clearly defining and communicating the workflow rules ensures the entire team understands how work should be done. Setting explicit policies creates visible boundaries and expectations that can reduce context switching. These are some examples of policies that I’ve found work well:,"It’s worth implementing Lean philosophies more generally too. Conduct an operations review: Look at the current ways of working and identify opportunities for improvement and reducing “waste”; that is, eliminate any legacy processes, tasks, or activities that could lead to context switching. These might include:\n\nUnnecessary meetings: Revisit the objectives and audience of regular meetings. Do all developers need to attend? Can the meeting frequency be decreased?\n\nManual processes: Pinpoint any current processes or clerical duties that could be automated. Perhaps developers usually send an email after moving tasks through the workflow. Could this notification be triggered automatically?","The ability to juggle multiple tasks has become an implicit expectation for Agile teams, particularly software developers. While avoiding context switching altogether may not be feasible, integrating the above practices into your team’s workload can mitigate its adverse effects. By creating detailed, efficient workflows, limiting work in progress, measuring cycle time, establishing explicit policies, and implementing process improvements, you can create a more predictable work environment, empowering software development teams to plan and manage their tasks more proactively. Remember to conduct a regular review of these processes to ensure they are optimized for service delivery.","  Vikas is a project management expert with rich experience across a range of industries such as education, banking, IT, and e-commerce.

Product goals are measurable, time-bound objectives that clarify the product’s purpose and desired outcomes. A lack of well-defined goals increases the likelihood of misaligned efforts, feature creep, and inefficient resource allocation. This can lead to failure to meet real user needs or achieve business objectives, as evidenced in the case of Google Glass—the splashy wearable tech that ultimately didn’t appeal to users.\n\nWhen companies set out to develop digital products, they typically focus on goals like revenue generation, user satisfaction, and scalability. To gather insights and align on the product vision, product teams conduct stakeholder interviews and hold workshops or kickoff meetings. These activities should yield the answers to three key questions:","Conducting thorough research and analyzing relevant information helps designers make informed decisions and ensure that the final product effectively meets user expectations. Teams that don’t conduct comprehensive research will end up with products that fail to target user pain points, align with market needs, or stand out from competitors.\n\nResearch methods such as user surveys, competitive analysis, and market research are complemented by tools such as user personas and empathy maps to organize and visualize findings effectively. User personas represent target users based on research data, guiding the product design team toward user-centric goals and informed product decisions. Empathy maps capture and categorize end users’ sentiments, behaviors, and pain points, helping teams understand and empathize with their experiences. For example, mapping user frustrations with elements of the booking process on a hotel website aids teams in identifying specific aspects of the design that need to be improved, such as the checkout flow.",,"of developing products that do not align with user expectations, leading to potential usability issues and costly revisions later on; this was the case with the 2014 launch of a flawed Apple Maps, which led to a formal apology by CEO Tim Cook after users complained about the service’s geographic errors and information gaps.\n\nIn the early stages of design, when I am outlining the primary structure of a webpage or an app’s core navigation, I begin with simple paper sketches or low-fidelity wireframes. Paper sketching, a key aspect of my creative process, enables quick visualization and easy modification. Other popular tools for creating low-fi wireframes include MockFlow, Justinmind, and Flinto. As project complexity increases, utilizing tools like Figma, Sketch, and InVision will allow you to build and showcase high-fidelity prototypes. Showcasing hi-fi prototypes is a method often used in data visualization and multistep processes that require user-input verification, such as user registration or password reset flows.\n\nWhen projects demand an in-depth simulation of the final product, designers can create promptframes. These advanced prototypes blend functionality, layout, and AI-generated cues, such as instructional text and call-to-action buttons, to guide user interactions within a product interface. This method can provide contextual guidance or enable real-time interactions for potential users or stakeholders. For instance, in telemedicine applications featuring medication reminders and virtual consultations, a lifelike demonstration might be necessary to illustrate how the platform enriches patient care.\n\nWell-designed prototypes are powerful communication tools for showcasing a product’s potential and functionality to stakeholders and clients. At SBSC, a software consulting firm, I collaborated with business developers on several occasions to create clickable prototypes that we used when bidding on project contracts. Our interactive prototypes ensured we won three of those bids. Now, at WriteSea, an AI-enabled career services platform, we use prototypes in our sales calls to show prospective customers the product roadmap’s features and also in our user research sessions to get early feedback.","User testing is conducted throughout the product design process, but testing prototypes produces the most effective results as it provides instant value to the design team. Testing prototypes allows design teams to validate concepts, identify user experience issues, and gather qualitative feedback before the product is fully developed. This iterative process helps prevent costly changes post-launch and ensures the product is functional and aligned with user needs and expectations.\n\nUser testing incorporates stakeholders and target users into the prototyping process to collect a range of perspectives and insights. Specific methods include conducting usability testing sessions, gathering feedback through surveys, interviews, or focus groups, analyzing user interactions with prototypes, and observing user behavior to identify pain points and areas

Fine-tuned LLMs are models that have received further training, making them more useful for specialized industries and tasks. LLMs are trained on language data and have an exceptional command of syntax, semantics, and context; even though they are extremely versatile, they might underperform with more specialized tasks where domain expertise is required. For these applications, the foundation LLM can be fine-tuned using smaller labeled datasets that focus on specific domains. Fine-tuning leverages supervised learning, a category of machine learning where the model is shown both the input object and the desired output value (the annotations). These prompt-response pairs enable the model to learn the relationship between the input and output so that it can make similar predictions on unseen data.",,,,,,,,,,,,"""172a9a0c3084da3d4db2b248f09e90fb""",,,,,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,,,,2024-12-18T04:16:16.793Z,,,,,,,,2024-12-18T04:16:16.793Z,,,,,,,,image/avif,,,,,,,,images.avif,,,,,,,,48703,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/18122024094616/images.avif,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/18122024094616/images.avif,,,,,,,,"""172a9a0c3084da3d4db2b248f09e90fb""",,,,,,,,200,,,,,,,,SYMNWSEMQ78KPWC6,,,,,,,,XNwHBIqKdBqdKJ1qxWJm3/HlhU7MxCHKMalngO2s+J5NNKKaWwutimnTiBBBFEL4cuvqwMrMa4g=,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"""172a9a0c3084da3d4db2b248f09e90fb""",,,,,,,,AES256,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/18122024094616/images.avif,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/18122024094616/images.avif,,,,,,,,images.avif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48703,,,,,,,,\n\n\n        </>\n    )\n},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6757f777b0c5736f0b049059,6757f777b0c5736f0b04905a,Ayan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its latest release included extensive UI updates, giving users more control over their workspace. Adobe XD is no longer available for purchase as a standalone application, but still supports existing users in “maintenance mode,” and continues to offer integration across the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. Sketch is the application of choice for many designers using Mac, valued for its screen design focus and plugin range. Version 100, an important update released earlier this year, saw important improvements to its interactive prototyping capabilities.\n\nThere isn’t necessarily one tool that’s best for all design projects, but a detailed feature comparison can be invaluable when selecting the right design platform. Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch each offer a distinct set of capabilities that can cater to specific design needs—let’s explore how they compare.",,,,,,,,,,,,"""172a9a0c3084da3d4db2b248f09e90fb""",,,,,,,,BLOG_SECTION_IMAGE,,,,,,,,2024-12-18T11:06:27.775Z,,,,,,,,2024-12-18T11:06:27.775Z,,,,,,,,image/avif,,,,,,,,images.avif,,,,,,,,48703,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/18122024163627/images.avif,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/18122024163627/images.avif,,,,,,,,"""172a9a0c3084da3d4db2b248f09e90fb""",,,,,,,,200,,,,,,,,P912T8NJ18M3YKJQ,,,,,,,,FwXaZMhXwn1KdBYRa+/+8B+nLYP7J3wDeWvkCxeH5AkpYZe5nMhTjcBXQ6reORJsBSEPn0h5rYajj2IVaoIaXA==,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"""172a9a0c3084da3d4db2b248f09e90fb""",,,,,,,,AES256,,,,,,,,hiretalentt,,,,,,,,blog_section_image/18122024163627/images.avif,,,,,,,,https://hiretalentt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_section_image/18122024163627/images.avif,,,,,,,,images.avif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48703,,,,,,,,"      />\n               <Button\n                  onClick={() => router.push(""http://workshps.localhost:3000"")}\n                  severity={""help""}\n                  size={""small""}\n                  label={""Workshps Website""}\n               />\n            </div>\n            <div className=""flex align-items-center justify-content-center gap-3"">\n               <Button\n                  onClick={() => router.push(""http://app.hiretalentt.localhost:3000/dashboard"")}\n                  size={""small""}\n                  label={""Hire Talent App""}\n               />\n               <Button\n                  onClick={() => router.push(""http://app.workshps.localhost:3000"")}\n                  severity={""info""}\n                  size={""small""}\n                  label={""Workshps App""}\n               />\n            </div>\n         </div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6757f777b0c5736f0b049059,6757f777b0c5736f0b04905a,Ayan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I aim to be cautious about making specific claims about current trends since my knowledge cutoff was in 2024, we can explore the technological trajectory that was already becoming clear. The foundation model era has matured considerably, with AI systems becoming increasingly sophisticated at understanding and generating human language, code, and multimedia content. These models are now being deployed across industries, from healthcare to education, with a growing focus on specialized AI tools designed for specific professional domains. Privacy-preserving AI has gained prominence, with new techniques for training models on sensitive data while maintaining confidentiality. Edge AI continues to expand, bringing powerful AI capabilities to local devices without requiring cloud connectivity. Perhaps most significantly, we're seeing the emergence of AI systems that can engage in more sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, moving beyond pattern recognition to handle more complex cognitive tasks.</p>","<p>Lorem Ipsum&nbsp;is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
